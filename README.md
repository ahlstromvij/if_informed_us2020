# If Informed

There has been a lot of talk recently about “fake news” and other form of voter misinformation. Looking ahead at the 2020 Presidential election, I recently built a website, “If Informed,” where US voters can find out what political positions they likely would have taken, had they been fully informed. 

The underlying models use large-scale survey data from the American National Election Study to tease out what combinations of demographic factors and levels of political knowledge tend to go with what political attitudes. This also makes it possible to estimate what attitudes people would have taken, had they been just the way they are across those demographic factors, but highly politically informed. 

The website is part of a broader research project on the role of knowledge in political choice, and the underlying models are based on a long-standing tradition on so-called ‘information effects’ and a more recently established methodology of counterfactual modelling in the social sciences. The website is a collaboration with Alfred Malmros, and builds on a previous website that we built on the basis of British Election Study data in the lead-up to the 2019 General Election in the UK.
