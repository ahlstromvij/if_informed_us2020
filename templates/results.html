    <h3>Taxation: Taxing the Rich</h3>
    <p>In an interview, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) suggested that income above $10m may need to be taxed up to 70%. Currently, the highest marginal Federal tax rate in the US is 37%.</p>
    <strong><p>Do you favor taxing those making $10 million a year or more at a 70% rate?</p></strong>

    <h3>Diversity and Race: Slavery and Discrimination</h3>

    <h3>Would you be a fully informed conservative or progressive?</h3>
    <a id="user_answers"><a>
    <p>Fiscal conservatives want free markets and small government. Fiscal progressives see a substantial role for government in people's lives.</p>
    <p>Social progressives value diversity and social justice, and stand in opposition to social conservatives.</p>
    <p>In each case, moderates take a position in between.</p>

<button type="button" class="collapsible">How does this work?</button>
<div class="collapsible-content">
    <br />
    Consider a simple example:
    <p>Say I want to predict how much you earn but all I know about you is your age. I might ask lots of people their age and their income, and then note the relationship.</p>
    <p>Maybe it turns out that, in general, the older you are, the more you make (until retirement age, say). If I describe that relationship using an equation — being of this age means likely earning this much — I now have a model that I can use to predict your income.</p>
    <p>Now, perhaps a better model would also look at people’s level of education, years of relevant work experience, and so forth. And when we include further variables like this, we can do something else: we can estimate how much you would have earned, had you been different along one of the variables involved.</p>
    <p>For example, maybe you never went to university. How much would you have earned now if you did? We plug in all of the relevant values for you into the model (your age and so on), but set the level of the education variable to ‘university educated’ and, voilà, the model estimates how much someone who’s just like you, except for being more highly educated, would likely earn.</p>
    In our model of informed political opinion, we do something similar. We ask you to plug in a variety of demographic and socioeconomic variables. But the model has an additional variable that you don’t get to set: how politically informed you are. We’ve already set that one to the maximum value. That's how we estimate what political attitudes you likely would have held, had you been fully informed.
</div>

<button type="button" class="collapsible">Why did you not ask me about my values?</button>
<div class="collapsible-content">
    <br />
    The reason we estimate your informed vote on the basis of demographic variables while excluding values is not that the latter aren’t predictive of how you <i>will</i> vote (they are); it’s that they are not predictive of how you <i>would</i> vote, if fully informed.
    <p>This is because, if you were more informed, it's quite possible that you would embrace different values from what you currently do.</p>
    That means that, if you include values variables in the model, you hold fixed things that in fact vary with increased knowledge, which in turn would bias your estimate. (In the modeling literature, this is known as 'controlling for a mediator'.)
</div>

<button type="button" class="collapsible">How do you measure what it is to be 'fully informed'?</button>
<div class="collapsible-content">
    <br />
    You do it by asking large numbers of people to, for example, pair up named individuals with their political offices, or about political platforms, political practices, and so forth.
   <p>This is something political scientists have been doing for some time, and it turns out that, by asking people a few, well-chosen factual questions, you can derive a good measure of how politically informed they are. </p>
   <p>In light of this tradition, the main surveys of political attitudes, such as the American National Election Studies and the British Election Study, now generally include a number of such factual questions in their national surveys.</p>
   <p>Researchers can then use these to define what you can think of as a 'political knowledge score'. That’s the score we set to the maximum in our model, when estimating your fully informed opinions.</p>
   Those interested in more details may consult Michael X. Delli Carpini and Scott Keeter and Scott Althaus's work on 'information effects'.
