    <h3>Taxation: Taxing the Rich</h3>
    <p>In an interview, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) suggested that income above $10m may need to be taxed up to 70%. Currently, the highest marginal Federal tax rate in the US is 37%. By contrast, Sweden has a 70% marginal tax rate which kicks in at around $98,000.</p>
    <strong><p>Do you favor taxing those making $10 million a year or more at a 70% rate?</p></strong>

    <p>Many people are concerned about levels of inequality between the rich and the poor. Some moreover feel that government should play a role in reducing these levels.</p>

    <h3>International Trade: Impact on Jobs</h3>
    <p>In a globalised economy, international trade plays a central role in the lives of all of us, from the services we expect, and the products we want. At the same time, some worry that international trade has a negative impact on U.S. jobs.</p>

    <p>Daca is a federal government program created in 2012 to protect people brought to the US illegally as children. Those with Daca status are known as "Dreamers". By the time Trump announced his decision in 2017 to rescind the program, 787,580 had been granted approval.</p>

    <h3>Would you be a fully informed conservative or liberal?</h3>
    <p>Economic liberals want free markets, low taxes, and small government. Social liberals value diversity and social justice. And in each case, moderates take a position in between.</p>
    <p><strong>Where would your fully informed self fall on these two dimensions?</strong></p>
    <p>Based on the estimates made in relation to the questions you have seen, your fully informed self would likely be <strong>{{ econ_liberal_position }}</strong> and <strong>{{ social_liberal_position }}</strong>.</p>
    <p>Your positions here compare as follows, in terms of the answers we would expect from the following politicians:</p>

<button type="button" class="collapsible">How does this work?</button>
<div class="collapsible-content">
    <br />
    Consider a simple example:
    <p>Say I want to predict how much you earn but all I know about you is your age. I might ask lots of people their age and their income, and then note the relationship.</p>
    <p>Maybe it turns out that, in general, the older you are, the more you make (until retirement age, say). If I describe that relationship using an equation — being of this age means likely earning this much — I now have a model that I can use to predict your income.</p>
    <p>Now, perhaps a better model would also look at people’s level of education, years of relevant work experience, and so forth. And when we include further variables like this, we can do something else: we can estimate how much you would have earned, had you been different along one of the variables involved.</p>
    <p>For example, maybe you never went to university. How much would you have earned now if you did? We plug in all of the relevant values for you into the model (your age and so on), but set the level of the education variable to ‘university educated’ and, voilà, the model estimates how much someone who’s just like you, except for being more highly educated, would likely earn.</p>
    In our model of informed political opinion, we do something similar. We ask you to plug in a variety of demographic and socioeconomic variables. But the model has an additional variable that you don’t get to set: how politically informed you are. We’ve already set that one to the maximum value. That's how we estimate what political attitudes you likely would have held, had you been fully informed.
</div>

<button type="button" class="collapsible">Why did you not ask me about my values?</button>
<div class="collapsible-content">
    <br />
    The reason we estimate your informed vote on the basis of demographic variables while excluding attitudinal and values variables is not that the latter aren’t predictive of how you <i>will</i> vote (they are); it’s that they are not predictive of how you <i>would</i> vote, if fully informed.
    <p>This is because, if you were more informed, it's quite possible that you would embrace different values and have different political attitudes from what you currently do.</p>
    That means that, if you include attitudinal and values variables in the model, you hold fixed things that in fact vary with increased knowledge, which in turn would bias your estimate. In the literature, this is known as 'controlling for a mediator'. Julia Rohrer has <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/2515245917745629">a good and accessible paper on this</a>, for those interested in more details.
</div>

<button type="button" class="collapsible">How do you measure what it is to be 'fully informed'?</button>
<div class="collapsible-content">
    <br />
    You do it by asking large numbers of people to, for example, pair up named individuals with their political offices, or about political platforms, political practices, and so forth.
    <p>This is something political scientists have been doing for some time, and it turns out that, by asking people a few, well-chosen factual questions, you can derive a good measure of how politically informed they are. </p>
    <p>In light of this tradition, the main surveys of political attitudes, such as the <a class="bold_link" href="https://electionstudies.org/">American National Election Studies</a> and the <a class="bold_link" href="https://www.britishelectionstudy.com/">British Election Study</a>, now generally include a number of such factual questions in their national surveys.</p>
    <p>Researchers can then use these to define what you can think of as a 'political knowledge score'. That’s the score we set to the maximum in our model, when estimating your fully informed opinions.</p>
    Those interested in more details may consult the central books on ‘information effects’ by <a class="bold_link" href="https://yalebooks.yale.edu/book/9780300072754/what-americans-know-about-politics-and-why-it-matters">Michael X.
