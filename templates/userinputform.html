        <cf-robot-message cf-questions="So we rely on shortcuts. For example, many of us listen to our more informed friends’ opinions. We think: if this person is 'quite like me' and really knows what’s going on, their opinion is worth hearing."></cf-robot-message>

        <label for="checking_in_2">You can think of this website as telling you what a particularly knowledgeable friend thinks about a number of political issues—where that friend just happens to be a highly-informed version of you.</label>

        <cf-robot-message cf-questions="George Box, a prominent statistician, supposedly said that all models are wrong, but some are useful. In the same vein, we are under no illusion that our models' estimates are 100% accurate, and neither should you be."></cf-robot-message>

        <label for="checking_in_3">What we do know, however, is that we need to have a discussion about knowledge in politics. These models help us have that discussion on the basis of some solid data, rather than pure speculation.</label>
