        <label for="checking_in_1">In a moment, we will ask you a few questions. Using data from the American National Election Studies, we will then estimate what position you likely would have taken on a number of political issues, had you been fully informed.</label>

        <label for="checking_in_2">Politics is hard and few of us are able to keep up with the constant flow of political developments. So many of us listen to our more informed friends’ opinions. We think: if this person is 'quite like me' and really knows what’s going on, their opinion is worth hearing. Think of this website as telling you what a particularly knowledgeable friend thinks about a number of political issues—where that friend just happens to be a highly-informed version of you.</label>
        <select id="checking_in_2">
            <option name="cfc-intro" id="intro-yes" value="yes">But why do this?</option>
        </select>

        <label for="checking_in_3">George Box, a prominent statistician, supposedly said that all models are wrong, but some are useful. In the same vein, we are under no illusion that our models' estimates are 100% accurate, and neither should you be. What we do know, however, is that we need to have a discussion about knowledge in politics. These models help us have that discussion on the basis of some solid data, rather than pure speculation.</label>
