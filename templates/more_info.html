        <p>By looking at large-scale survey data, you can tease out what combinations of demographic factors (e.g., age, gender, race) and levels of political knowledge tend to go with what political attitudes.</p>
        <p>Moreover, once you have done that, you can estimate what attitudes people <i>would have</i> taken, had they been just the way they are across those demographic factors, but also highly politically informed.</p>
        <p>That’s what we’re estimating for you here. We ask you to plug in a variety of demographic variables. But our models have an additional variable that you don’t get to set: how politically informed you are. We’ve already set that one to the maximum value.</p>
        <p>This is known as <strong>counterfactual modeling</strong>, the idea being the we are estimating what would happen if we could somehow flip a switch to make you fully informed, thereby realising a situation that is not (hence, counterfactual): one where you are fully informed, but otherwise exactly the way you are.</p>
        <p>For those interested in learning more, <a href="http://bayes.cs.ucla.edu/BOOK-2K/" target="_blank"><strong>Judea Pearl's <i>Causality: Models, Reasoning, and Inference</i></strong></a> is the central text here.

    <button type="button" class="collapsible">Why did you not ask me about my values?</button>
    <div class="collapsible-content">
        <br />
        <p>That depends on what you mean by 'values.'</p>
        <p>You might mean what political scientists call 'partisanship' - roughly, your sense of identification with some political party or cause. The reason we do not ask you about that is that, while predictive of what political attitudes you <i>will</i> take, partisanship is not necessarily predictive of what attitudes you <i>would</i> have taken, had you been fully informed. </p>
        <p>This is because, if you were more informed, you might have identified with a different partisan cause than you currently do, given that partisanship is likely affected by political knowledge - specifically, knowledge of party and candidate positioning.</p>
        <p>This means that, if you include partisanship in the models that estimate the attitudes of your fully informed self, you hold fixed things that in fact vary with increased knowledge, which biases your estimates. (In the counterfactual modeling literature, this is known as 'controlling for a mediator'.)</p>
        <p>Alternatively, you might mean by 'values' something more fundamental, something like the foundations for partisanship, and specifically the political bonds and attachments formed very early in life as part of a broader process of socialisation. So, why are we not asking you about those? </p>
        <p>Well, in a sense, we are. Socialisation is centred around group-identity considerations relating to religion, race, gender, and the like - all helping shape our conceptions of who we are, and consequently also what positions ‘people like us’ take in politics. Consequently, in so far as we ask you about your gender, race, and religion, we are likely already capturing a substantial part of the very factors that provide the foundation for your most fundamental values.</p>

    <button type="button" class="collapsible">How do you measure what it is to be 'fully informed'?</button>
    <div class="collapsible-content">
        <br />
        <p>You do it by asking large numbers of people to, for example, pair up named individuals with their political offices, or about political platforms, political practices, and so forth.</p>
        <p>This is something political scientists have been doing for some time, and it turns out that, by asking people a few, well-chosen factual questions, you can derive a good measure of how politically informed they are.</p>
        <p>In light of this tradition, the main surveys of political attitudes, such as <strong><a href="https://electionstudies.org/" target="_blank">the American National Election Studies</a></strong> (whose data we're using here),  generally include a number of such factual questions in their national surveys. Researchers can use these to define a 'knowledge score'. That’s the score we set to the maximum in our models, when estimating your fully informed opinions.</p>
        <p>Those interested in more details may consult the work of <strong><a href="https://yalebooks.yale.edu/book/9780300072754/what-americans-know-about-politics-and-why-it-matters" target="_blank">Michael X.

    <button type="button" class="collapsible">How did you determine my 'informed' ideology?</button>
    <div class="collapsible-content">
        <br />
        <p>As mentioned, some researchers think that <strong><a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/43783740?seq=1" target="_blank">ideology has two dimensions</a></strong>, a social and a fiscal/economic. For purposes of this platform, we calculate</p>
        <ul>
            <li>your <strong>fiscal conservatism score</strong> by adding up the estimated probabilities that an informed version of you would answer ‘no’ on the questions about free college, free Pre-K, reducing inequality through legislation, and government action on climate change, and ‘yes’ on free trade being good for the U.S. (&#x03B1; = 0.73); and</li>
            <li>your <strong>social progressivism score</strong> by adding up the estimated probabilities of ‘yes’ on the questions about diversity being good, racial discrimination, wanting more immigrants, dreamers being allowed to stay, and letting in refugees (&#x03B1; = 0.77).</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <button type="button" class="collapsible">How did you pair me up with a politician?</button>
    <div class="collapsible-content">
        <br />
        <p>First, we estimate <strong>fiscal conservatism</strong> and <strong>social progressivism</strong> scores for each of the five politicians mentioned, based on the answers we expect they would give to these questions, as follows:</p>
        <ul>
              <li><strong>Trump</strong>: A social progressivism score of 0 and an fiscal conservatism score of 4.</li>
              <li><strong>Romney</strong>: A social progressivism score of 2 and a fiscal conservatism score of 5.</li>
              <li><strong>Biden</strong>: A social progressivism score of 4 and a fiscal conservatism score of 2.</li>
              <li><strong>Warren</strong>: A social progressivism score of 5 and a fiscal conservatism score of 1.</li>
              <li><strong>Sanders</strong>: A social progressivism score of 5 and a fiscal conservatism score of 0.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Then, we calculate the distance (as a straight line in two-dimensional space) between the scores of your fully informed self, and that of each of these politicians, and let you know who is closest to your informed self along these two dimensions.</p>

    <div class="collapsible-content">
        <br />
        <p>The dataset used is the <strong><a href="https://electionstudies.org/data-center/2019-pilot-study/" target="_blank">ANES 2019 Pilot Study</a></strong>. The knowledge variable was constructed using an item response theory model in R’s <code>ltm</code> package from four knowledge items in the dataset. Tests on the resulting model suggested unidimensionality, local independence, and a good fit. The causal effect of knowledge on each of the political attitudes items was estimated using 'doubly robust' estimation. Specifically, propensity scores were calculated using R’s <code>twang</code> package, and then used as weights in a set of logistic regression models, first fitted using <code>glm</code> in R for purposes of diagnostics (to confirm significance of the knowledge variable, measure fit, rule out multicolinearity, and check for robustness in light of any influential observations) and then again using <code>LogisticRegression</code> in <code>scikit-learn</code> for online deployment with Django.</p>
